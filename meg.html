    <p>
    In 1985, Megadeth released its debut album, Killing Is My Business...
    and Business Is Good!, on the independent record label Combat Records,
    to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led
    to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album,
    Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and was a major hit
    with the underground metal scene. Substance abuse and personal disputes
    brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period.
