    Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music
    community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums.
    The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986), was described as one of
    the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous
    fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in
    heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving
    substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the
    United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan
    era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in
    subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with
    the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar
     praise to that of the band's earlier albums.
