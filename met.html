      Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music
      community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums.
      The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986), was described as one of
      the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous
      fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in
      heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving
      substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the
      United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan
      era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in
      subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with
      the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar
       praise to that of the band's earlier albums.

  In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file
  sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists
  filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected
  material without consent; after reaching a settlement, Napster became a
  pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed
  2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented
  the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and
   the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica
   was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the
   screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film Metallica:
   Through the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.
