# Project 0
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is the project 0 for the course on web programming. Each file is named for what it contains, this meaning that bootstrap.css shall store all the bootstrap styling used during the project, stylesheet.css shall store all the non-bootstrap code used, and so on; The only exception to this rule would be sass.sccs for it contains inheritance coding. Nevertheless, this wouldn't represent an issue since it's known that inheritance is a feature provided by Sass.

I wanted to talk about my favorite music bands in this web page, these are Metallica and Megadeth yet I enjoy listening to classical music and jazz. That being said, you will find in the HTML files the information for each hyperlink created on the main page, with an acronym for each band. This is, met.hmtl would be the file for Metallica, meg.html for megadeth, clas.html for classical music, and mis.html for the miscelaneous page (jazz and rap).
