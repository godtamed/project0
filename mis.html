    European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European
    classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation,
    in use since about the 11th century.[2][3] Catholic monks developed the
    first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize
    liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by
    composers to indicate to the performer the pitches and durations for a piece of music
