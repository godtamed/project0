<h3 id=mis1>Jazz</h3>
<p>
  Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States.[1] It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.[2] Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music".[3] Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. <a href="mis1.html">here</a> if you want to know more about the artist that I like.

The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone).
